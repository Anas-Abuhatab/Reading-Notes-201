<p style="color:rgb(25, 0, 255)">The National Vaccination Campaign to fight COVID-19 is carried out by the Ministry of Health and the National Centre for Security and Crises Management.
Any individual on Jordanian soil is eligible to receive the vaccine, and it is free-of-charge. Therefore, you do not have to pay any fees.
Receiving the vaccine is not mandatory, which means you choose whether to receive it or not. However, we encourage you to register to receive the vaccine, especially if you are an elderly, or suffer from chronic illnesses such as heart diseases, diabetes, cancer, respiratory or blood-related illnesses.</p>

<p style="color:chartreuse">Please get your information on the vaccine and its efficiency from official and trusted sources, and avoid rumours, which could be harmful for your safety and health and your community.
<h3>Fighting this pandemic and limiting the spread of the coronavirus is a collective effort and responsibility</h2>.</p>
